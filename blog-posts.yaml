    Lyon is a fantastic city to visit, especially if you enjoy walking. Each neighborhood has something unique to offer, and in just one or two days, you can see a lot. Here's a simple itinerary to make the most of your time.  

    ###<span style="color:var(--bleu-clair);"> 1. The Basilica of Fourvi√®re  </span>
    üîé* Viewpoint, Basilica, amphitheatre.*

    Start your visit by taking the funicular up to the **Basilica of Fourvi√®re** *(2‚Ç¨ metro ticket from Vieux-Lyon station, line F2)*.
    
    Built in 1872, it's one of the city's most iconic landmarks. The interior is stunning, full of color and detail. From the esplanade, the view over Lyon is breathtaking.  

    On your way down, stop by the **Roman theaters of Fourvi√®re**. These ancient ruins, with the city in the background, are really impressive. Walk downhill, and you'll arrive in the heart of **Vieux Lyon** (Old Lyon).  


    ###<span style="color:var(--rouge-clair);"> 2. Old Lyon ‚Äì The Renaissance District  </span>
    üîé* Cathedral, Italian Renaissance architecture, traditional food, traboules (passageways), museums...*

    This **UNESCO-protected area** is one of the best-preserved Renaissance neighborhoods in Europe. The colorful Italian-style buildings, **Saint-Jean Cathedral**, and the hidden **traboules** (secret passageways) make it a must-see. Take your time wandering the narrow streets, and maybe stop for a local snack like a praline brioche.  

    *The Bouchons (typical Lyonnaise restaurants)* are everywhere in town, but you'll find some good ones in the old town. Watch out! They're among the tourist traps, so check the reviews first!

    **üëâ The best way to explore Vieux Lyon is by taking [my guided tour of Lyon and its passageways](https://quentinwalkingtour.com/book/vieux-lyon-booking.html) :)**


    ###<span style="color:var(--orange);"> 3. Croix-Rousse ‚Äì The Silkworkers' Hill  </span>
    üîé* Food market, silk history, vintage shops, hipster area, local restaurants, caf√©s & bars.*


    Take the funicular up to **Croix-Rousse**, the historic silk district. This neighborhood has a special atmosphere, with street art, markets, and history around every corner. Walk down the hill and pass by:  
    - **Le Mur des Canuts**, the largest painted mural in Europe  
    - **Croix-Rousse Market**, a must-visit for local produce and crafts  
    - **La Maison des Canuts**, a museum about Lyon's silk industry  
    - **La Cour des Voraces**, one of the most famous traboules  

    In Croix-Rousse, you'll find many restaurants, local young chefs, and more contemporary (*vegetarian!*) cuisine. Walk around Mont√©e de la Grande C√¥te and the perpendicular streets to find a caf√©, restaurant, jazz bar, or a bar for the night.

    **üëâ The best way to explore Croix-Rousse is by taking [my guided tour of Croix-Rousse](https://quentinwalkingtour.com/book/croix-rousse-booking.html) :)**


    ### <span style="color:var(--rouge-fonce);">4. The City Center ‚Äì La Presqu'√Æle  </span>
    üîé* Shopping, 19th century architecture, city hall, museums, restaurants.*

    Between the **Sa√¥ne** and **Rh√¥ne** rivers, this is the lively heart of Lyon. Here, you'll find:  
    - **Place Bellecour**, one of the largest squares in Europe  
    - **Place des Terreaux**, with the impressive City Hall and the Fine Arts Museum  
    - **L'H√¥tel-Dieu**, a former hospital turned into a beautiful shopping and dining area  

    This part of the city was developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries and is full of elegant architecture, shops, and caf√©s.  

    
    ### <span style="color:var(--pink);">5. Modern Lyon ‚Äì La Part-Dieu & Les Halles  </span>
    If you have time, explore the modern part of the city beyond the Rh√¥ne River. You can visit **La Part-Dieu**, Lyon's business district, or stop by **Les Halles Paul Bocuse**, the famous food market where you can taste Lyon's traditional specialties.  

    In just a day or two, you'll get a great feel for Lyon's history, architecture, and food. The best way to explore? Just walk and enjoy the city!

    Moving around Lyon is easy and cheap. Note that it's a super walkable city but here are the three main options you can use to explore the city without your feet.

    ###<span style="color:red;"> 1. üöá Public Transport (TCL)</span>

    In Lyon, we're quite proud of our public transport. It's **clean, efficient**, and way better than in many cities (<span style="font-style:italic;">hi Parisians üëã</span>).

    To use the **metro, tram, bus, or funicular**, you can simply **tap your credit card** at the entrance gate (usually a red box).  
    A ride costs **2‚Ç¨**, and the ticket is valid for **1 hour**, so you can switch lines without paying again.

    Don't miss the **funicular** that goes up to **Croix-Rousse** and **Fourvi√®re**. It's included in the metro system and gives you a nice little ride up the hills.

    Buses are also **very reliable**. If your map suggests one, take it... it's usually a good idea.

    ### <span style="color:blue;">2. üé´ Lyon City Card (for activities)</span>

    As I said, the **metro is already cheap and easy**, so you don't need a special card just to ride.

    But the **Lyon City Card** can be a **good deal if you plan to do some activities** like museums, river cruises, or guided visits.

    For me, if you want to do **more than 3 activities** during your stay, it's worth it.

    You can buy it at the **Tourist Office**, or on their [official website](https://boutique.visiterlyon.com/lyon-city-card). 

    ### <span style="color:green;">3. üö≤ Rent a Bike (V√©lov')</span>

    **V√©lov'** is the city bike system in Lyon. You'll see the **red bikes** (regular) and the **green ones** (electric) all over the place.

    It's really cheap ‚Äî about **2‚Ç¨ for 30 minutes**. You can rent one using the **V√©lov' app** or directly through their **website**.

    <span style="font-style:italic;">To be honest, the app can be buggy. I usually go with the web version as it works better.</span>

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Just make sure there's a **bike station where you're going**, so you can return the bike easily. Don't worry, there are stations pretty much everywhere in the city.

    For me, renting a bike is the best option **if you dare to face the terrible app üòÇ.**

    Lyon is known for its hidden passageways, called traboules, which are often tucked between buildings. Some traboules are open to the public thanks to agreements between their residents and the city. 
    
    *<span style="color:green;">There are officially 31 open to visitors. You can find the open traboules on some maps, **[here is one of them](https://traboules.fr/carte.html)**.</span>*

    **Be careful while walking through traboules:** Many people live in these buildings, so please be discreet. Speak quietly, and wait until you're back on the street before chatting or making noise.

    ### Some Notable Traboules of Lyon

    - **<span style="color:blue;">La Longue Traboule</span>**: This is the most famous traboule in Vieux Lyon. It connects Rue Saint-Jean to Rue du B≈ìuf through 3 courtyards and 4 buildings.  
    - *<span style="color:blue;">Entrance: 54 Rue Saint-Jean.</span>*

    - **<span style="color:pink;">La Tour Rose</span>**: A former traboules (you can't got all the way through anymore) where you can still admire a surprisingly pink tower :)*
    - *<span style="color:pink;">Entrance: 22 Rue du B≈ìuf.</span>*

    - **<span style="color:orange;">La cour des Voraces</span>**: In the downhill of Croix-Rousse, between Place Colbert and Rue Imbert-Colom√®s. It's a must-see for its history and impressive architecture, with 6 floors and many steps.
    - *<span style="color:orange;">Entrance: 9 Place Colbert.</span>*

    **You can discover even more traboules in my guided tours of Lyon and its passageways :)**

    The **Lyon City Card** is a tourist pass that gives you **free access to museums**, **public transport**, **river cruises**, and **guided visits**. But is it really worth it? Here's a simple breakdown to help you decide.

    #### üéüÔ∏è <span style="color:#FFC300;">What's included?</span>

    With the card, you get:

    - Free access to **25+ museums**, including the **Mus√©e des Confluences**, **Fine Arts Museum**, and **Lumi√®re Museum**
    - Unlimited use of **metro, buses, trams, funiculars** (TCL)
    - One **cruise on the Sa√¥ne river** (in season)
    - Several **guided tours** (Old Lyon, Fourvi√®re, etc.)
    - Discounts on shows and activities

    You can choose between **1, 2, 3 or 4-day cards**.

    #### üí∞ <span style="color:green;">How much does it cost?</span>

    - **1 day**: about 30‚Ç¨
    - **2 days**: about 40‚Ç¨
    - **3 days**: about 50‚Ç¨
    - **4 days**: about 60‚Ç¨

    (There are discounts for kids and students.)

    #### ü§î <span style="color:blue;">So‚Ä¶ is it worth it?</span>

    It really depends on your plans.

    For me, it's **worth it if you plan to do at least 3 activities** in one or two days. Here's a simple example:

    - Mus√©e des Confluences: 12‚Ç¨
    - River Cruise: 15‚Ç¨
    - Guided Tour: 14‚Ç¨
    - Metro Tickets for 1 day: 7‚Ç¨

    ‚ûú Total: **48‚Ç¨**, and that's just for 1 day. So yes, in this case, the 1-day card for 30‚Ç¨ is a good deal.

    If you only plan to walk around and visit places from outside, then maybe not. The metro is cheap (2‚Ç¨ per ride), easy to use and many beautiful places are free to explore. Here is my article on [how to move around Lyon](https://quentinwalkingtour.com/blog/how-to-go-around-lyon.html).

    #### üõí <span style="color:pink;">Where to buy it?</span>

    - At the **Tourist Office** on Place Bellecour
    - On the **official website** [link here](https://boutique.visiterlyon.com/lyon-city-card)
    - In some hotels and partner places

    You'll get a **physical card** or a **QR code** to use from your phone.

    #### üß≠ <span style="color:gray;">My tip:</span>

    Take a moment to list what you want to visit in Lyon.  
    - If you're going to **2 museums, a cruise, and want to use the metro**, go for it.  
    - If you prefer **just walking and taking one or two metro rides**, maybe skip it.

    Either way, the card is **well made**, easy to use, and really helps you save time ‚Äî no lines at museums, no need to buy separate tickets. Just tap and go.

    <span style="color:red;">**Anyway, city card or not, joining my tour is free!**</span>
