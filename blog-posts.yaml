    Lyon is known for its hidden passageways, called traboules, which are often tucked between buildings. Here's how you can explore them while being respectful to the residents.

    ## How to Access Traboules

    Some traboules are open to the public thanks to agreements between their residents and the city. There are officially 31 open to visitors, and we’ve listed the most interesting ones below.

    ## Visiting Closed Traboules

    Want to visit a closed traboule? You can try early in the morning when the doors are sometimes open for the trash collectors or the postman. Just press the open button, star, or zero and see if it works. 

    **Be careful while walking through traboules:** Many people live in these buildings, so please be discreet. Speak quietly, and wait until you're back on the street before chatting or making noise.

    ## Some Notable Traboules in Vieux Lyon

    - **La Longue Traboule**: This is the most famous traboule in Vieux Lyon. It connects Rue Saint-Jean to Rue du Bœuf through 3 courtyards and 4 buildings.  
    - **Entrance**: 54 Rue Saint-Jean.

    - **Traboules of Croix-Rousse**: The traboule at the Cour des Voraces, between Place Colbert and Rue Imbert-Colomès, is both a passageway and a staircase. It's a must-see for its history and impressive architecture, with 6 floors and many steps.  
    - **Entrance**: 9 Place Colbert.
