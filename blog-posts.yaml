    Lyon is known for its hidden passageways, called traboules, which are often tucked between buildings. 

    Some traboules are open to the public thanks to agreements between their residents and the city. There are officially 31 open to visitors. You can find the open traboules on some maps, [here is one of them](https://traboules.fr/carte.html).

    **Be careful while walking through traboules:** Many people live in these buildings, so please be discreet. Speak quietly, and wait until you're back on the street before chatting or making noise.

    #### Some Notable Traboules of Lyon

    - **La Longue Traboule**: This is the most famous traboule in Vieux Lyon. It connects Rue Saint-Jean to Rue du Bœuf through 3 courtyards and 4 buildings.  
    - *Entrance: 54 Rue Saint-Jean.*

    - **La vour des Voraces**: In the downhill of Croix-Rousse, between Place Colbert and Rue Imbert-Colomès. It's a must-see for its history and impressive architecture, with 6 floors and many steps.
    - *Entrance: 9 Place Colbert.*

    **Both these traboules are included in my guided tours of Lyon and its passageways :)**
