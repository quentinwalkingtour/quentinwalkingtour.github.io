    Lyon is a fantastic city to visit, especially if you enjoy walking. Each neighborhood has something unique to offer, and in just one or two days, you can see a lot. Here’s a simple itinerary to make the most of your time.  

    ### 1. The Basilica of Fourvière  
    <span style="color:orange;">*Summary: viewpoint, Basilica, amphitheatre.*</span>

    Start your visit by taking the funicular up to the **Basilica of Fourvière** *(2€ metro ticket from Vieux-Lyon station, line F2)*.
    
    Built in 1872, it’s one of the city’s most iconic landmarks. The interior is stunning, full of color and detail. From the esplanade, the view over Lyon is breathtaking.  

    On your way down, stop by the **Roman theaters of Fourvière**. These ancient ruins, with the city in the background, are really impressive. Walk downhill, and you’ll arrive in the heart of **Vieux Lyon** (Old Lyon).  


    ### 2. Old Lyon – The Renaissance District  
    <span style="color:orange;">*Summary: cathedral, Italian Renaissance architecture, traditional food, traboules (passageways), museums...*</span>

    This **UNESCO-protected area** is one of the best-preserved Renaissance neighborhoods in Europe. The colorful Italian-style buildings, **Saint-Jean Cathedral**, and the hidden **traboules** (secret passageways) make it a must-see. Take your time wandering the narrow streets, and maybe stop for a local snack like a praline brioche.  

    *The Bouchons (typical Lyonnaise restaurants)* are everywhere in town, but you'll find some good ones in the old town. Watch out! They're among the tourist traps, so check the reviews first!

    Lyon is known for its hidden passageways, called traboules, which are often tucked between buildings. Some traboules are open to the public thanks to agreements between their residents and the city. 
    
    *<span style="color:green;">There are officially 31 open to visitors. You can find the open traboules on some maps, **[here is one of them](https://traboules.fr/carte.html)**.</span>*

    **Be careful while walking through traboules:** Many people live in these buildings, so please be discreet. Speak quietly, and wait until you're back on the street before chatting or making noise.

    #### Some Notable Traboules of Lyon

    - **La Longue Traboule**: This is the most famous traboule in Vieux Lyon. It connects Rue Saint-Jean to Rue du Bœuf through 3 courtyards and 4 buildings.

    - *Entrance: 22 Rue du Bœuf.*

    - **La cour des Voraces**: In the downhill of Croix-Rousse, between Place Colbert and Rue Imbert-Colomès. It's a must-see for its history and impressive architecture, with 6 floors and many steps.

    If you're looking for an day trip from Lyon, there are a few nice destinations to consider. 
    Whether you're into **history, nature, or wine**, these places are all **easily accessible** from Lyon, and each offers its own charm.

    #### 1. **Pérouges** – A Beautiful Medieval Village

    Just a short trip from Lyon, Pérouges is one of France’s most beautiful medieval villages. 
    It’s incredibly well-preserved, giving visitors an idea of what life was like in the Middle Ages. 

    - **How to Get There**: You can reach Pérouges by bus in just about 45 minutes from Lyon.
    - **My Recommandations**: Wander through its streets, admire the charming stone houses, and take in the views of the surrounding countryside. Don’t forget to try the "Galette de Pérouges," a local pastry.

    #### 2. **Annecy** – A Picturesque City by the Lake

    Annecy, often referred to as the "Venice of the Alps," is a beautiful city located around 1.5 hours from Lyon. With its stunning lake, crystal-clear waters, and charming canals. **If you were thinking about visiting Geneva,** Annecy offers a more tranquil and scenic experience.

    - **My Recommendations**: Walk along the lake, explore the Old Town with its colorful buildings and winding canals, and hike up to the Château d'Annecy for panoramic views.

    #### 3. **Vienne & Condrieu** – Wine Valley Escape

    If you're a wine lover, a trip to Vienne and Condrieu, located south of Lyon, is a must. These charming towns are set along the Rhône River and are home to some of the best wineries in the region. 

    - **How to Get There**: Vienne is about 30 minutes by train from Lyon. Condrieu is a little further, but you can also reach it by bus or car.

    Moving around Lyon is easy and cheap. Note that it's a super walkdable city but here are the three main options you can use to explore the city without your feet.

    #### 1. 🚇 <span class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Public Transport (TCL)</span>

    In Lyon, we’re quite proud of our public transport. It’s **clean, efficient**, and way better than in many cities (<span class="italic">hi Parisians 👋</span>).

    To use the **metro, tram, bus, or funicular**, you can simply **tap your credit card** at the entrance gate (usually a red box).  
    A ride costs **2€**, and the ticket is valid for **1 hour**, so you can switch lines without paying again.

    Don’t miss the **funicular** that goes up to **Croix-Rousse** and **Fourvière**. It’s included in the metro system and gives you a nice little ride up the hills.

    Buses are also **very reliable**. If your map suggests one, take it... it’s usually a good idea.

    #### 2. 🎫 <span class="text-yellow-600 font-semibold">Lyon City Card (for activities)</span>

    As we said in the other article, the **metro is already cheap and easy**, so you don’t need a special card just to ride.

    But the **Lyon City Card** can be a **good deal if you plan to do some activities** like museums, river cruises, or guided visits.

    For me, if you want to do **more than 3 activities** during your stay, it’s worth it.

    You can buy it at the **Tourist Office**, or on their **official website**.  
    <span class="italic">https://boutique.visiterlyon.com/lyon-city-card</span>

    #### 3. 🚲 <span class="text-green-600 font-semibold">Rent a Bike (Vélov’)</span>

    **Vélov’** is the city bike system in Lyon. You’ll see the **red bikes** (regular) and the **green ones** (electric) all over the place.

    It’s really cheap — about **2 to 3€ for 30 minutes**. You can rent one using the **Vélov’ app** or directly through their **website**.

    <span class="italic">To be honest, the app can be buggy. I usually go with the web version as it works better.</span>

    Just make sure there’s a **bike station where you’re going**, so you can return the bike easily. Don’t worry, there are stations pretty much everywhere in the city.

    For me, renting a bike is the best option **if you dare to face the terrible app 😂.**
